<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>We recommend using the ionic utility to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template. 
For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the ionic utility is installed:</p>

`$ sudo npm install -g ionic`

Then run:

`$ sudo npm install -g ionic`

`$ ionic start myProject tabs`


More info on this can be found on the Ionic Getting Started page.

<h3>Installation</h3>

While we recommend using the ionic utility to create new Ionic projects, you can use this repo as a barebones starting point to your next Ionic app.

To use this project as is, first clone the repo from GitHub, then run:

`$ cd ionic-app-base` 

<h3>Issues</h3>
